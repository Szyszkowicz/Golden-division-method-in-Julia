## General info
This project is simple implementation of golden division method write in Julia.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Julia 1.0.3
* Jupyter Juliabox

	
## Setup
To run this project, put it loccally in Julia IDE, or use Juliabox online.

## Futures
* Searching for a minimum function
* Adjustment of the accuracy tolerance of the result is possible
* Ability to change search ranges
* The possibility of giving any function of one variable

## How to use?
All you have to do is enter the function, the range of searches you want, and the accuracy of the result, as shown below:
`f(x) = put-your-function-here /n
a = put-your-first-range-here \n
b = put-your-second-range-here
tol = put-your-accuracy-here`
